# Bluenex's personal blog

This is my personal blog forked from Jekyll Now. This blog has no intention to be commercial nor seeking for personal benefit. I occasionally update the blog because this blog is kind of diary and personal geek note, but I don't have that many stories in my everyday life. That's why I choose to start blogging on Github not on mainstream blogging service site. 

## How to run

This is just reminder because it happens to me several times when trying to run the blog locally. Yes, I forgot how to freaking run it. 

Before, I don't know why `Gemfile` was included in the `.gitignore`, but it could simply be run using `jekyll serve`. At the time I'm writing this readme, it cannot. After configuring for a while I found that using `bundler` makes things simple. 

`Gemfile` is no longer included in `.gitignore` so when clone this repo to new pc, first thing to do is:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

After that simply serve using:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The blog should be up and running on `localhost:4000` or `127.0.0.1:4000`.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
